# Hackathon Management System 

Developed for Glasgow University Tech Society (GUTS). 

This is a Django website which was designed to help GUTS manage their hackathons. It is capable of managing participants, questions, judges and their marking. The system was designed to be stateless in nature, i.e. this project does not maintain a state. Things like sessions, file management, database etc. were centralized to AWS services to ensure easy scalability.
